## Description of the application
The application is made for two people who want to meet. The problem is that they do not know where and both parties do not want to travel to far. The solution for this problem is to meet in the middle! So the user fills in two addresses and the app gives te middle in a red marker on the map. Around the red marker are three purple marker with the top three nearest cafes/bars/restaurans. By tapping on the marker an infowindow is shown. By tapping the infowindow, you will do to the details about that places such ass name, address, rating an if it's open.
